![alt text](https://github.com/isneuu/ui-feedback-tool-chrome-extension/blob/main/UIF.gif "Preview")



### Use case: When you have to quickly copy UI and send Feedback
 
### How to use:
1. Install Extension
2. Click the extension, select your HTML Div
3. Automatically it copies the image

It uses dom-to-img library to get it done.

> Caution: Please wait till the status says "Copied." Sometimes some divs it doesn't copy and copy it well.
 
If you can do better, please do! It's totally free. Enjoy!
